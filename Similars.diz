File::Searcher::Similars -- Similar file locator, which walks along the given dirs
to find all similar files, not only identical ones: different version (.txt,
.html, or .pdf) and different compression methods (.zip, .gz, .tar.gz, .bip2),
MP3 files with different sample rates, etc. It uses advanced soundex vector
algorithm to determine the file similarities.
